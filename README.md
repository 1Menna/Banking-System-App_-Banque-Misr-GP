# 💳 Banking System App  

## 📌 Project Idea  
A simple **Angular application** that simulates a **banking system**.  
The app demonstrates key Angular concepts such as **routing, dependency injection, guards, lazy loading, pipes, enums, and HTTP services**.  

### 👤 Roles  
- **User** → Manage accounts, view transactions, perform fund transfers.  
- **Admin** → Manage users (CRUD operations, activate/deactivate accounts).  

### 🔑 Key Features  
- Role-based **login and dashboards** (Admin/User).  
- **User Dashboard**: View account details, transfer funds, list transactions.  
- **Transactions Page**: Filter & search transactions (Credit/Debit).  
- **Admin Dashboard**: Manage users (Add/Edit/Delete, Activate/Deactivate).  
- **Navbar**: Role-based navigation + logout.  

### 🛠️ Concepts Covered  
- **Dependency Injection** (AuthService, AccountService, UserService).  
- **Routing & Guards** (role-based access).  
- **Lazy Loading** (User & Admin modules).  
- **Enums** (AccountType, TransactionType).  
- **Custom Pipes** for filtering transactions.  
- **Mock API Integration** for accounts & transactions.
